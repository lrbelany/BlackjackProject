##Blackjack Project

##Description
This app is a blackjack game. You win by having an amount to cards equal to 21 or less,
however the value of your cards still has to be higher than the dealers. If there is a tie
It is a draw and you can reset the game if you wish to continue paying

you can hit to add cards to your hand to have a higher hand value than the dealer.

Dealer only has one card revealed at first then

dealer hits below 17, and stands at 17 or above.

after a winner is declared the user can chose to stop playing or keep going

if the cards get low enough a prompt to reset the game should display and the user can choose to keep going
or exit the program

#What I learned
First and foremost I am starting to get a lot more comfortable with
calling .methods. To fully understand and implement all of the concepts I have learned over the past few weeks, I will need a lot more repetitions to have a full grasp of everything, and even more time and reps to gain a level of mastery.
I can look things up somewhat, but that takes time and disrupts work flow because I need to translate what I looked up, into something that is able to fit the puzzle so to speak.
I think above all else I learned to keep pushing myself to keep trying things no matter how many bad/incorrect ideas I have.
This project hands down I had the most trials, errors and test classes.

#Application deficiencies and bugs
Was not able to successfully implement try catch.
when prompts are given for specific user input,
incorrect input bugs the program and asks if the
user would like to play again and exits the program
on a second invalid entry. Ace's only equal 11.
